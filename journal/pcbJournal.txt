hi i forgot to journal my pcb schematic the other day soooo

5/21/25
my idea for the controller:
wifi or bluetooth MCU, at least 4 buttons
2 joysticks for robot "tank drive"

final choice: the specific esp32 footprints i need are weird
i'm designing my own esp32 integration i guess

nevermind! the wemos c3 mini is perfect for this, and much easier to wire

wemos c3 mini notes:
i'm 1 pin short for my original plan of using 5 buttons :(
oh well, back to 4 it is

pcb design finished! (components.png)
